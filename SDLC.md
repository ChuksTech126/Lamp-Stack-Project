Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) – Summary

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software development teams to plan, design, build, test, deploy, and maintain software systems. It provides a clear roadmap that ensures software is developed systematically, meets user requirements, and maintains quality throughout its lifetime.

**What SDLC Is**

SDLC is essentially a methodology that breaks down the entire software creation process into distinct stages. It helps guide development teams from the initial idea all the way to delivery and ongoing maintenance. Each stage has goals, deliverables, and quality checkpoints.

Why SDLC Is Important

Ensures organized development — teams follow a logical sequence of steps.

Improves quality and predictability — by integrating testing and review throughout the process.

Reduces risk and rework — issues are detected early rather than after deployment.

Improves communication — stakeholders know what to expect at each stage.

Common Phases of SDLC

While specific models may vary, most SDLC frameworks include these core phases:

Planning – Define project goals, scope, timeline, and resources.

Analysis / Requirements – Gather and document detailed system requirements.

Design – Create architectural and technical specifications.

Implementation / Development – Developers write the application code.

Testing – Verify that the software works as intended and fix defects.

Deployment – Release the software to production users.

Maintenance – Provide updates, bug fixes, and enhancements after release.

Some models combine or rename these steps, but the core idea remains the same.

SDLC Models

Different SDLC models describe how these phases connect, such as:

Waterfall – Linear and sequential.

Agile – Iterative and incremental for flexibility.

Spiral – Combines iteration with risk management.

Iterative / Incremental – Repeated cycles of development.

These models help teams choose how rigid or flexible the process will be.
